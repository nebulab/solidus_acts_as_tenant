This extension adds multi-tenant support to solidus using the row-level tenancy [acts_as_tenant](https://github.com/ErwinM/acts_as_tenant/commits/master/) gem.

It adds tenant scoping to a configurabale set of models and adds a console utility to switch between tenants.

## Installation

Add solidus_act_as_tenant to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_act_as_tenant'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_act_as_tenant:install
```

## Usage

See the [acts_as_tenant](https://github.com/ErwinM/acts_as_tenant) gem for an explanation of how tenant scoping works.

To configure this extension for your project, see:

- The generated migration files
- The generated tenant_aware_models.yml file
- The generated initializer.rb file


There is also a console utility that can be used to simply manage tenants in the console.
To use it, you can add it to your `~/.irbrc` file or `~/.pryrc` file:

```ruby
if defined?(Rails)
  TS = SolidusActAsTenant::Utils::TenantSelector.new

  IRB.conf[:IRB_RC] = proc do
    #   * TS.ask             => anytime in console, to switch tenant from a list
    #   * TS.current         => same as Apartment::Tenant.current
    #   * TS.tenants         => hash of tenants. Example: { 0 => "Demo Company" }
    #   * TS.switch_tenant!(tenant_name) => same as ActsAsTenant.current_tenant = Tenant.find_by(name: tenant_name)
    TS.ask
  end
end
```

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
You can load Solidus core factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusActAsTenant::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```
