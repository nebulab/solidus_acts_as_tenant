# Any model that is already defined and has an a tenant column can be added to this list.
# It is not restricted to the Solidus models so it can be used for any model that is inherited from a gem.

# It is importnant to also note that any unique indexes on the database will need to replaced with a unique index on scoped to the tenant column.

# Format:
  # - [Class name, [uniqueness attributes to update with tenant scope]]
  # The uniqueness attributes array are optional for cases where there is already a uniqueness validation on the model that are not scoped to the tenant column.

# Notes regarding Solidus models:
  # These are are classes that are created in this extention because they are not defined in Solidus:
    # [Spree::ProductTaxon, []],
    # [Spree::ReimbursementCredit, []],

  # These are classes that don't need a tenancy but may be desired:
    # [Spree::Country, []],
    # [Spree::State, []],
    # [Spree::PermissionSet, []],
    # [Spree::Role, [:name]],
    # [Spree::RolePermission, []],

  # These are not needed at all as they are internal to Solidus (and may cause issues):
    # [Spree::OrderMutex, []],
